    <section class="blog-body">
        <div class="body-text">I finished 58 books in total in 2022, so on average slightly over one book a week. And in this article, I will share THE ONE THING I learned from this year's reading.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">What motivated me to read more?</div>
        <div class="body-text">I used to be a bookwarm as a kid, always holding a book when I eat. 
            which contributed to my stamache issue, so don’t really recommend.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Things started to changed when I was in college. In my freshman year, I still read for a few minutes before bed but ever since sophomore year, in which I have more commitments: course work, student work, internships, I read less and less. After I started to work, sitting 8 hours in front of the laptop gave me more excuse to turn to instant gratification for a relief. But around a year ago, I found myself struggle to make it through a paragraph. The girl who used to hold a novel at every lunch before her bowl of noodles, who loves to read, who loves to think, is nowhere to be found. </div>    
        <div class="body-text">And I miss her so much. </div>    
        <div class="body-text">Therefore, when I made my new year resolutions one year ago, I  set the goal of reading 24 books because I read 21 books last year and I thought oh I’ll try to read a little bit more this year, 2 books a month seems nice. But after I had finished 25 books before July, I started to think maybe I could do more and I did. 
        </div>    
        <div class="body-text" style="font-style: italic;">“People who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read”. — Stillness is the key</div>
        <div class="subtitle">How to read more</div>
        <div class="body-text">Common tips like reading 10 pages a day or listening to audio books just don’t work for me. I can’t even remember to wash my face everyday not to mention picking up a book consistently. I also didn’t and don’t want to sacrifice too much of other leisure activities you know I also watched 11 TV series, 10 TV shows and countless movies [quick and guilty]. 
            May the force forgive my lonely adulthood. </div>
        <div>So, what has worked?</div>
        <div><b>1. Read more than one book at a time</b> </div>
        <div>I learned this tip from a book <The almanack of naval ravikant>. In the book, he said he “At any given time, I’m reading somewhere between ten and twenty books”. I myself normally have 5-6 books at a time. The reason is when you get bored with one book, let’s say you’re stuck at the page 300, you just cannot read any further,             
            what do you do?  You stop you from reading as a whole. But with many books to read at the same time, you can always turn to another one that interests you more at the specific moment, and pick up from where you left later on.</div>
        <div>Some may find this approach leading to finishing no books at all. My suggestions are: first, you can set the goal of finish a particular book next month and concentrate on it. Second, what’s wrong with not finishing the book rapidly? Even if you don’t finish it this month, you could finish it next month. If not this year, you can finish it next year. As long as you are reading, you are growing. </div>
        <div><b>2. Follow your curiosity</b></div> 
        <div>Curiosity is the best guide when deciding on what to read and actually read it. </div> 
        <div>It’s totally fine to follow a book recommendation list or Sunday Times Best Seller if you don’t know what to read at first, but as you read more, you’d want to follow your curiosity. </div>  
        <div>I picked up <em>Getting Things Done </em>when I got interested in productivity; I picked up <em>Psychology of Money</em> when I determined to manage my personal finance better; I picked up <em>Cracking The PM Interview</em> when I thought of getting a new… Come on, I’m kidding. I love my job. Did you see that, boss? </div>
        <div>The right book will appear when you need it the most. </div>
        <div><b>3. Allow yourself to stop reading if you want to </b></div>
        <div>Strictly speaking, I didn’t really read one book a week. In some weeks I might be too consumed by my quarterlife crisis and/or my dirty apartment and thus didn’t bother read one single page while in some weeks I might finish 3 books straight as I just couldn’t put them down. Listen to your own rhyme: do I prefer to read or to watch a movie tonight? Follow your own curiosity: do I need a novel or a tool book that can help with my work today? You get to decide: reading benefits no one but you, only you. </div>
        <div class="subtitle">One Thing I learned </div>
        <div>After reading more than one book a week for a year, I learned one single thing: <em>The number of books completed is a vanity metric.</em> </div>
        <div>Why? Well first </div>
        <div><b>1.Actions speak the loudest </b></div>
        <div>Have you ever wondered: Why I read so many books, some so-called life-changing books, but my life is as static as f*? Because you never take action. </div>
        <div>It can be a physical action. </div>
        <div><em>The One Thing</em> can’t help you if you don’t identify your one thing. <em>Make Time</em> can’t help you if you don’t schedule your highlight. <em>Ultralearning</em> cannot help you if you never start your first ultralearning project. </div>
        <div>The action from <em>The 7 husbands of Evelvyn Hugo</em> is not to get a boob job and get married 7 husbands. FYI. </div>
        <div>Or it can be a shift in your mindset.  </div>
        <div>Let me give you an example. Growing up in a frugal family, I’m really judgy when it comes to how people spend money. I have a friend who just told me  <Ultralearning> is too expensive. Hearing this, the old me would think but you have a cat, I bet raising cats are way more expensive than buying a book. But I was reading <Psychology of money> then and the first chapter was: no one’s attitude towards money is crazy. “It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences.” Who am I to judge others? </div>
        <div class="subtitle">2. Reading takes up time for note taking and re-reading </div>  
        <div>When I looked back at the names of these books, I can only remember some quotes or plots. So, next year, I plan to take some notes from the books I read by writing done quotes from the books. Yes, only quotes, it’s my own of rereading books and feels like a therapy or self-care practice for. </div>  
        <div>I’m not a huge advocate of taking comprehensive notes of all books I read and build a profound system to keep the notes. For me, it makes reading kinda like a chore to me. But it work for some other people, maybe you’ll love it, everyone reads in their own way. It’s a such beautiful things that we can experiment and find the way that works best for ourselves. </div>
        <div><b>That’s why Reading itself is a bless, quantity doesn’t mean anything </b></div>
        <div>Sometimes, I would find myself turn to books that are obviously easy to read and avoid reading books that seems a bit boring, although I do know reading them would be really be useful, such as <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, a must read for product managers like me but I’m still on page 60 or <em>Why We Sleep</em>, which I always fell asleep while reading it. </div>
        <div>But maybe it’s what the author wants me to do. </div>
        <div>When you set your new year resolution of reading more next year, never turn it into a number game. You can just read one book a year and if that book completely changes your life, you’ll have one of your best years. </div>
        <div>It’s the inspiration you get from the books that matters; </div>
        <div>It’s the changes that happen in our life that matters; </div>
        <div>It’s the joyful time you spend flipping these page that matters. </div>
        <div>There’s a quote from Oprah’s <em>What I know for sure</em>: <em>“Everything I do all day, I do in preparation for my reading time. Give me a great novel or memoir, some tea, and a cozy spot to curl up in, and I’m in heaven.”</em></div>
        <div class="subtitle">3 books I recommend and my favorites quotes from them </div>
        <div>Let me unrreveal yearly awards that no one apart from me cares to these 3 books and 1 quote from each:  </div>
        <div><b>No.1 Big Panda and Little Dragon:</b> a book so beautifully written and drawn and should be on your night stand </div>
        <div><em>Just because you don’t know were you’re going, it doesn’t mean you’re lost. </em></div>
        <div><b>No.2 Quaterlife crisis:</b> as the roadmap has disappeared, we need to invent our own roadmap, together</div>
        <div><em>I decide if my life is how I want it to be. Welcome to the real world. It’s not exactly what I’d thought it’d be, but here I am. </em></div>
        <div><b>No.3 Four thousand weeks:</b> a book that will change your perspective on productivity and meaning of life</div>
        <div><em>The trouble with attempting to master your time is that time ends up mastering you. </em></div>
